# Node Installation

*Note: We highly recommended [following the instructions within the Timber app](https://app.timber.io), it provides an easy step-by-step guide.*

Depending on your platform you'll want write logs to STDOUT, a file, or deliver them over HTTP to the Timber service. If you're unaware which method to use, checkout our [HTTP, STDOUT, or log files doc](/guides/http-stdout-or-log-files/).

1. [**HTTP** - Recommended. Deliver logs directly from your app.](http)
2. [**STDOUT** - Advanced. Required external delivery.](stdout)
