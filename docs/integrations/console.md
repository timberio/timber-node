Timber for Node ships with an integration for the standard JavaScript `console` functions. This integration allows you to either output standard logs or append logs with custom metadata or events using the builtin `console.log` functions. See [usage](../../usage) for more details.

## Installation

This integration is automatically setup when you install Timber. Please follow the instructions for [installing Timber](../installation) to use the console integration.
